## Section 4: Genome Analysis

We'll start the secion with a 5 minutes presentation from each person on what they have learned about their genome from the RAST annoation.  We'll then proceed to predicting some features of an assembled genome dataset.

### RAST Annotation


### Predicting Proteins and Extracting ORFs



### Finding rRNA and tRNA genes



### Pairwise Blast -- Genome-to-Genome Comparison


### KEGG Annotation -- and KEGG Mapping




### Assessing Genome Completeness


## Metagenome Gene Frequencies

### Proportion of Arachae to Bacteria

### What proportion of a population carries a particular Gene ?
