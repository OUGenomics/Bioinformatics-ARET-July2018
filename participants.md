#PARTICIPANTS
Don’t leave without a network ! Here is a list of participants in the workshop. Stay in touch ! Talk to each other ! Help each other ! Even for those of us who have been doing bioinformatics work for many years, this is a never ending learning process, in part because the technology is moving as rapidly as ever and what’s not possible to day, may be entirely possible for you to achieve in the classroom next year.  The advances are going to continue and the technology will become ever more pervasive and important parts of your lives.
