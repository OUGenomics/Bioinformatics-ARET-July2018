## Prerequisites


### Installing Docker

First things first.  In all liklyhood you do not own a computer that runs linux - at least not in the way that we will need to use it in this course.  You first order of business is to install docker. Before you can do this, you need to create an account on dockerhub:

https://hub.docker.com/

Fill choose a user name and create an account:

Don’t forget to accept the privacy policy and terms of service.  Once you create your account, follow the instructions in the email that will be sent to you to finish the account setup.  

Then navigate to the homepage for the Windows installation, which can be found here:

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

You will be asked to to log into your account before you can download the installer.

Once you are logged in, download the stable windows client:

Save the file. Then locate it, double click it, and follow the instructions for installation.  This may take a while.  For a new installation it may require windows to install a range of dependencies.   After your installation, docker will start automatically, but upon rebooting, you’ll likely have to restart docker before you can use it.  If it auto-starts, I would unselect this option, since docker will use resources in the background.   To start docker, find the docker icon and double click:

Once docker is started, you'll need to open a powershell window.  I pin my powershell icon to the taskbar. If you don't know where to find it, click the windows icon and type 'powershell' into the search bar:
