# Why Bioinformatics ?

The past decade has seen a tremendous shift in the way biological science is conducted.  Many of the problems that are now routinely tackled as part of the average research project would have been insurmountable one a few short years ago.   Two fundamental advances have made this leap forward possible – new technolgoies for [DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) and raw rapid advances in computational horsepower allowing [computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) problems to be solved without the use of a supercomputer.


 Arguably the most important aspect of biology data revolution has been the ability to sequence whole genomes.  While the first full genome sequence (that of [bacteriophage φX174]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_X_174)) became available as early as 1977, the ability to sequence the complete genome of an organism remained out of reach for the average research project until very recent advances in DNA sequencing lowered the cost dramatically.  A series of technologies pushed the envelope in this area beyond the classical [dideoxy-Sanger sequencing]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) methodology, lowering the cost from dollars to fractions of a penny per kilobase of sequence.

The result, of course, is a tremendous amount of sequence data.  These data are historically deposited and made available to the public through the [National Center for Biotechnology Information]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), which maintain [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) our most important data repository.  As you can imagine, the [size of GenBank]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics/) has increase dramatically over recent  years.

Several other specialty databases have sprung up over the years to handle portions of GenBank that is used by a specialized research community.  We will be using one of these alternate repositories, [iMicrobe](https://www.imicrobe.us/), for this short-course (more on this in the activities).
