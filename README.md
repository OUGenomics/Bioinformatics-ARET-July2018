# Why Bioinformatics ?

The past decade has seen a tremendous shift in the way biological science is conducted.  Many of the problems that are now routinely tackled as part of the average research project would have been insurmountable one a few short years ago.   Two fundamental advances have made this leap forward possible â€“ new technolgoies for [DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) and raw rapid advances in computational horsepower allowing [computational biology] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) problems to be solved without the use of a supercomputer.
